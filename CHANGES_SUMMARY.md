# Summary of Changes

## New Components Created

1. **MainAgent System**
   - Created `app/agent/main_agent.py` - Core agent that coordinates all tools and requests
   - Created `app/agent/chat_handler.py` - Handler for general conversations
   - Created `app/agent/__init__.py` - Package initialization for the agent module

2. **Documentation**
   - Created `README_NEW.md` - New documentation explaining the architecture
   - Created `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Visual representation of the architecture
   - Created `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Guide for migrating from old to new architecture

## Modified Components

1. **API Routes**
   - Updated `app/api/routes.py` - Simplified to use MainAgent instead of separate processors

2. **Application Setup**
   - Updated `app/main.py` - Added MainAgent initialization at startup
   - Updated `run.py` - Enhanced logging and configuration

## Architecture Changes

1. **Unified Agent Approach**
   - Replaced separate GraphProcessor and ChatProcessor with a single MainAgent
   - Integrated tool selection, parameter handling, and execution in one component

2. **Streamlined Request Processing**
   - Simplified the flow from user request to tool execution
   - Eliminated manual parameter passing between components

3. **Enhanced Conversation Management**
   - Improved conversation history handling
   - Better parameter extraction from context

4. **Cleaner Tool Integration**
   - Maintained compatibility with existing tools
   - Centralized tool registration and execution

## Benefits

1. **Code Quality**
   - Reduced duplication and complexity
   - Better separation of concerns
   - More maintainable architecture

2. **Performance**
   - More efficient parameter handling
   - Streamlined decision making

3. **User Experience**
   - More consistent responses
   - Better context awareness

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Easier to add new tools
   - Simpler debugging and maintenance

## Migration Path

The migration from the old architecture to the new one follows these steps:

1. Add the new agent components
2. Update API routes to use the MainAgent
3. Update main.py to initialize the MainAgent
4. Keep all existing tools (no changes needed)

All changes are backward compatible, allowing for a gradual transition.

## Latest Updates

### Journey Document Functionality

Added support for journey document download and upload in the JourneyTool:

1. **Document Download**:
   - Enhanced `get_journey_report` to provide document content as base64-encoded data
   - Added a dedicated document operation for downloading documents through the main `/api/v1/process` endpoint
   - Documents remain stored in the `journey_reports` directory

2. **Document Upload**:
   - Added support for document uploads through the main `/api/v1/process` endpoint
   - Updated `check_journey_report` to accept base64-encoded document content
   - Modified documents are saved with a timestamp and "_modified" suffix

3. **Infrastructure Changes**:
   - All document operations are handled through the standard process route
   - No additional API endpoints required
   - Added proper error handling for file operations
   - Utilizes base64 encoding for document transfer

### Usage

#### Downloading Documents
To download a journey document:

```json
{
  "action": "document_operation",
  "document_action": "download",
  "journey_id": "your_journey_id",
  "document_name": "optional_specific_document_name.docx"
}
```

The response will contain the document content as base64-encoded data:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Journey document retrieved successfully.",
  "data": {
    "journey_id": "your_journey_id",
    "document_name": "journey_your_journey_id_20240501_123456.docx",
    "document_content": "base64_encoded_content",
    "file_size": 12345,
    "content_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"
  }
}
```

#### Uploading Modified Documents
To upload a modified document:

```json
{
  "action": "document_operation",
  "document_action": "upload",
  "journey_id": "your_journey_id",
  "document_content": "base64_encoded_content"
}
```

The response will include details about the uploaded file:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Document uploaded successfully.",
  "data": {
    "journey_id": "your_journey_id",
    "file_name": "journey_your_journey_id_20240501_123456_modified.docx",
    "file_path": "journey_reports/journey_your_journey_id_20240501_123456_modified.docx",
    "file_size": 12345,
    "timestamp": "20240501_123456"
  }
}
```
