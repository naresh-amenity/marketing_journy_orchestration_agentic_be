# 4. Craft highly personalized content that speaks directly to the persona's specific needs, interests, and motivations. This content should be engaging and persuasive, encouraging them to keep the mail piece and take advantage of the offered incentive.

#             {part_2_output}

#             ---

#             ### **Instructions for Technical Journey Mapping**

#             #### **1. Journey Structure Requirements**
#             - The journey must **start with an "Audience" node**.  
#             - **All journeys branches MUST END with a channel node** (Email, Direct Mail, or Digital Ads)
#             - **Never end a journey with a decision node, filter, or wait node**
#             - **Maximum of 3 distinct path branches** per journey to maintain clarity

#             #### **2. Correct Node Usage**
#             - **Wait Node**: 
#             - Use ONLY when timing is critical (e.g., 24-48 hour delays between messages)
#             - Do NOT use wait nodes as default between every action
#             - Specify exact wait duration (hours/days)
#             - Make sure in the planning putting Wait node directly after the artibute filter don't serve any perpous we need to use Wait node in the re engagement campaign 

#             - **Batch Node**:
#             - Use when multiple users need to be processed together
#             - Specify batch criteria (e.g., "Daily batch at 9 AM ET" or "Weekly batch on Mondays")
#             - Explain why batching is necessary for this segment
#             - Make sure in the planning putting batch node directly after the artibute filter don't serve any perpous we need to use batch node in the re engagement campaign 

#             - **A/B Test Node**:
#             - Use ONLY when testing two distinct approaches
#             - Specify exact split percentages (e.g., 50/50)
#             - Clearly define what differs between A and B variants
#             - Do NOT use A/B tests with only one outcome path
#             - Do NOT use more than two branches from an A/B test

#             - **Event Filter Node**:
#             - Use to segment based on specific user actions
#             - Clearly define the condition being evaluated
#             - Event node only comes after the marketing channel like the email, directmail or digital ad it will not come at starting or end.

#             #### **3. Channel Selection Logic**
#             - For each channel node (Email, Direct Mail, Digital Ads):
#             - Provide specific content/messaging
#             - Justify why this channel is appropriate at this stage
#             - Include estimated cost based on segment size
#             - Explain expected outcome/goal of this touchpoint

#             #### **4. Journey Validation**
#             - Review final journey and verify:
#             - Every path STARTS with a channel action
#             - Every path ENDS with a channel action
#             - Wait nodes are used strategically, not by default
#             - A/B tests have exactly two distinct paths
#             - Budget constraints are respected

#             Add all the things into the single Journey Path don't give multiple Journey Path

#             Make sure we are not repeating any intial marketing campaign to for the sub set of user or the other group.

#             We also need to make sure that in the intial marketing campaign we will never use the batch and wait node it will be used for the Re-engagement campaign only.

#             - **Identify key user segments that need re-engagement** (e.g., users who did not respond, abandoned cart users, inactive subscribers).  
#             - **Use the following journey components to drive engagement**:  
#                 - **Event Filter**: Trigger follow-ups based on user actions.  
#                 - **Wait Node**: Introduce strategic delays for better timing.  
#                 - **Batch Node**: Group audience for cost-effective execution.  
#                 - **A/B Test**: Optimize messaging by testing different approaches.

#             - Ensure that the **total cost of all actions (initial campaign + re-engagement) does not exceed `{total_budget}`**.  
#             - Prioritize the **most cost-effective re-engagement channels** based on their response rates:  
#                 - **Email** (most cost-effective but lower engagement).  
#                 - **Direct Mail** (higher engagement but expensive).  
#                 - **Digital Ads** (expensive, use selectively).  
#             - **If the budget is tight**, limit expensive actions and optimize user segmentation.  

#             #### **5. Expected Output Format**  
#             - Provide a **point-wise breakdown** of the re-engagement plan.

#             - Make sure in the planning putting Wait node directly after the artibute filter don't serve any perpous we need to use Wait node in the re engagement campaign 

#             - **Batch Node**:
#             - Use when multiple users need to be processed together
#             - Specify batch criteria (e.g., "Daily batch at 9 AM ET" or "Weekly batch on Mondays")
#             - Explain why batching is necessary for this segment
#             - Make sure in the planning putting batch node directly after the artibute filter don't serve any perpous we need to use batch node in the re engagement campaign 

#             - **A/B Test Node**:
#             - Use ONLY when testing two distinct approaches
#             - Specify exact split percentages (e.g., 50/50)
#             - Clearly define what differs between A and B variants
#             - Do NOT use A/B tests with only one outcome path
#             - Do NOT use more than two branches from an A/B test

#             - **Event Filter Node**:
#             - Use to segment based on specific user actions
#             - Clearly define the condition being evaluated
#             - Event node only comes after the marketing channel like the email, directmail or digital ad it will not come at starting or end.
            

#             #### **3. Channel Selection Logic**
#             - For each channel node (Email, Direct Mail, Digital Ads):
#             - Provide specific content/messaging
#             - Justify why this channel is appropriate at this stage
#             - Include estimated cost based on segment size
#             - Explain expected outcome/goal of this touchpoint

#             #### **4. Journey Validation**
#             - Review final journey and verify:
#             - Every path STARTS with a channel action
#             - Every path ENDS with a channel action
#             - Wait nodes are used strategically, not by default
#             - A/B tests have exactly two distinct paths
#             - Budget constraints are respected

#             Make sure we are not repeating any intial marketing campaign to for the sub set of user or the other group.

#             We also need to make sure that in the intial marketing campaign we will never use the batch and wait node it will be used for the Re-engagement campaign only.

#             #### **5. Expected Output Format**

You are a specialized marketing automation expert. Your task is to analyze the provided technical journey map input and transform it into a structured campaign journey map with phases and steps derived directly from the data.
            Instructions:

            1. Carefully analyze the provided technical journey map data about re-engagement campaigns.
            2. Extract the natural phases that emerge from the data. These phases should represent logical groupings of activities in the customer journey (e.g., initial awareness, targeting, nurturing, conversion).
            3. DO NOT use predefined phase names. Instead, identify and name the phases based on the actual flow and purpose of activities described in the input data.
            4. For each identified phase, extract the relevant steps from the input data.
            5. For each step, include:
                Trigger: What initiates this step
                Channel: Communication method used
                Target: Specific audience segment
                Content: Details of the message including headlines, body content, and CTAs


            6. Format the output with phases as main headers and steps as subheaders, like this:

            **[Phase Name Extracted from Data]**
            **Step 1:**
            * Trigger: [Trigger extracted from data]
            * Channel: [Channel extracted from data]
            * Target: [Target audience extracted from data]
            * Content:
            * [Content details extracted from data]
            * [Additional content details as needed]

            7. The output should maintain consistent formatting with asterisks for bullet points, proper indentation, and clear organization by phase and step.
            8. Focus on extracting the actual journey structure that exists in the data rather than forcing it into any predefined framework.

            Input Data:
            {journey_report}
            Now analyze this input data and extract the natural journey map structure, organizing it into phases and steps based solely on what's present in the data.
